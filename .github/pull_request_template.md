Thank you for opening a Pull Request!

---

Before submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:
- [ ] Make sure to open a GitHub issue as a bug/feature request before writing your code!  That way we can discuss the change, evaluate designs, and agree on the general idea
- [ ] Ensure the tests and linter pass
- [ ] Code coverage does not decrease (if any source code was changed)
- [ ] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)
- [ ] Will this cause breaking changes to existing Java or Kotlin integrations? If so, ensure the commit has a `BREAKING CHANGE` footer so when this change is integrated a major version update is triggered. See: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
