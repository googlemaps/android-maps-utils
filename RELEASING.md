Releasing
=========

1. Auto-generate the changelog for the latest version using [conventional-changelog-cli]
    e.g. `conventional-changelog -p angular`
2. Inspect the autogenerated changelog, make modifications as needed, and update [CHANGELOG.md].
3. Update the [README.md] "Installation" section with the new version of the library
4. Update the version in [gradle-mvn-push.gradle] with the new version of the library
5. Create a pull request with the changes with the title "chore(Release): <version_number>"
6. Once the pull request has been merged, create a git tag and push it (Travis will handle publishing to Maven)
7. Create a GitHub release with the tag
