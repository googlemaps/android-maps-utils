## Introduction

This open-source library contains classes that are useful for a wide range of applications using the [Google Maps Android API](http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/maps.html).

The library is under heavy development, but ready for use. Check the [issue tracker][issues] to see what's happening.

## Getting Started

The current version of the library is `0.3.2`.

### Android Studio/Gradle

Add the following dependency to your Gradle build file:

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.google.maps.android:android-maps-utils:0.3+'
    }

### Maven

Add the following to your `pom.xml`:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.maps.android</groupId>
        <artifactId>android-maps-utils-apklib</artifactId>
        <version>0.3+</version>
        <type>apklib</type>
    </dependency>

_Note: you must have Google Play services included in your project already.
See [JakeWharton/gms-mvn-install](https://github.com/JakeWharton/gms-mvn-install) for one way to do this._

### Eclipse/ADT

The library is distributed as a Android library project.
See the [guide on Android developers](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject) for instructions on setting up a library project.

Check out the repository from [GitHub][github] and reference the `library` subdirectory.

_(zip download is coming soon)_

## Feedback

Feedback and feature requests can be filed on the GitHub [issue tracker][issues].

<p id="source"></p>
## Source code

The project is hosted on [GitHub][github].

### Building the project

The project uses the Gradle build system. Use of the Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`) is preferred, as it keeps the build more contained ("hermetic", if you enjoy that kind of thing).</p>

Ensure your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set correctly. This may be something like `"/Applications/Android Studio.app/sdk/"` on Mac OS X.

You will also need to download the "Google Repository" in the SDK Manager. (You should be using it in your project already!)

    # Build everything
    $ ./gradlew assemble

    # Run tests
    $ ./gradlew instrumentTest

    # Install demo app on connected device
    # Don't forget to put your own API key in AndroidManifest.xml!
    $ ./gradlew installDebug
